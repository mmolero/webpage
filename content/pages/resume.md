Title: Resume


I have over 10 year experience working as R&D Engineer, focusing on digital signal and image processing, machine learning, data visualization, numerical modeling and simulation. 

I received my PhD from the Technical University of Madrid in 2009, working on the field of ultrasonic NDT, modeling and simulation.

Experience: 

- Development of systems based on Machine Learning and Data Visualization.
- Development of novel inspection and imaging systems for ultrasonic technologies. 
- Numerical modeling and simulation using GPU Computing (OpenCL) . 
- Development of software (real-time acquisition, data processing and visualization).  
- Development of 2D/3D viewers and processing tools for Point Clouds (Lidar & Laser Scanning).

Now I am with Telespazio Iberica, working on image processing and machine learning R&D for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and applications.

I enjoy solving any problem with python and machine learning techniques. I am very interested in deep learning research and data science applications.
